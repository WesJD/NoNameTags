# NoNameTags
Since Minecraft 1.8, F1 (or hide GUI) does not hide player name tags. This Forge mod simply does not render name tags when you have F1 enabled.

## Usage
Download Forge and drop it in your mods folder. You're good to go!

## Downloading
You can download a compiled jar [here](http://wesjd.github.io/downloads/index.html).
